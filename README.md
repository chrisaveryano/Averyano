# Overview

### Front End

The front end of the portfolio was made entirely with plain JavaScript code using ECMAScript 2015+ features without any frameworks like Angular, React or Vue. It's using libraries such as [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) and [Lodash](https://lodash.com/). To generate our static files that will be uploaded to the environment, we're using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

### Back End

The back end of the portfolio was made with [Express](https://expressjs.com/). There's nothing fancy happening in the logic of it, it's just a bunch of routes and some data that will populate our [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) views.

## Installation

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your machine, these are our only dependencies to run the project locally.
